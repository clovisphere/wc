# wc

> **wc** (short for word count) is a command in Unix, Plan 9, Inferno, and Unix-like operating systems. The program reads either standard input or a list of computer files and generates one or more of the following statistics: newline count, word count, and byte count. If a list of files is provided, both individual file and total statistics follow.

### How to run the program

```console
make          # create executable
./bin/wc -h   # display manual or help message
make clean    # always clean after yourself 😃
```
